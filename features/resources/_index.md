## Requirements

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Resource listing
=======
### Listing resources
>>>>>>> Initial feature commit
- As a user I want to have an overview of my resources with the most important information at a glance
- As a user I always want to know the path of the resource I'm currently working in
- As a user I want to be able to navigate to all parents of the resource I'm currently working in with a single click
- As a user I have potentially many resources (~100k) and my experience should not be impacted by this
