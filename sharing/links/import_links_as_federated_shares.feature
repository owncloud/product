Feature: Import links as federated shares

- As an ownCloud user who receives a link to a resource from another ownCloud user I want to add the resource to my account to be able to easily find it again and to work with it using ownCloud features.
- Importing links between users from the same instance should not create federated shares https://owncloud.my.salesforce.com/5000Z00001EEzqW
